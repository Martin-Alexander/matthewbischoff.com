# About The Author

My full name is Matthew Stephen Bischoff, but you can call me Matt. At the time of writing I'm eighteen years of age. I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on the [eve of New Years Eve] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_30 "December 30") in the year nineteen hundred and ninety. I currently live in the state of New Jersey.

I attend St. Joseph's Preparatory School, in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.

# About This Site

I write here. I write on no particular schedule and about no definite range of topics. My posts range in length from a single sentence to several printed pages. More often than not, I write about technology, culture, music, travel, and ideas, punctuated with accounts of major goings-on in my life.

This site has gone through many iterations over the years. Before its incarnation as a weblog, "al3x.net":http://al3x.net was a portfolio for my early attempts at web and graphic design, maintained by hand and updated via FTP. I eventually migrated the site to an early version of "Blogger":http://blogger.com and began updating more frequently.
