On April 3, 2008, I stumbled upon what has become my favorite piece of comedic entertainment. [_You Look Nice Today: A Journal of Emotional Hygiene_](http://youlooknicetoday.com "You Look Nice Today") is an improvisational podcast co-hosted by [Merlin Mann](http://merlinmann.com "Merlin Mann"), [Scott Simpson](http://twitter.com/scottsimpson "Scott Simpson"), and [Adam Lisagor](http://twitter.com/lonelysandwich/ "Adam Lisagor"). The occasionally weekly audio program takes the form of a half-hour to hour long conversation between three self-professed misanthropes who frequently attempt to think of ways to generate money for their show and follow random tangents to hilarious conclusions. Merlin, Scott, and Adam play themselves in what sounds like a audio-only and much wittier version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)">The Office</a> or slightly less campy and much less musical [Flight of the Conchords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Conchords "Flight of the Conchords").

Much of the show's utterly specific humor is derived from the sarcastic, ironic, and ridiculous statements, bits, and interactions the hosts deliver interlaced with perfectly timed musical interludes and voiceovers by someone who is "not" [John Hodgman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hodgman "John Hodgman"). The trio earn each and every laugh with their impeccable timing, delightful wit, and the occasional slur, sexual, or scatological joke. If I had to describe the show's content to someone who had never listened, I might call it an **improvisational romp of geeky, technical, and good old-fashioned humor from three of the funniest personalities on the Internet**.

Of course _You Look Nice Today_ is not the most "family friendly" piece of entertainment. Here's a content advisory from the show's [About](http://youlooknicetoday.com/about "About You Look Nice Today") page:

> Nota bene: You Look Nice Today is an audio program that has been prepared by and for “adults.” As a Journal of Emotional Hygiene, our program tackles many of the painful issues typically encountered by persons of this awkward age. Consequently, an uncontrollable level of candor and seemingly non-stop tsunami of profanity may be encountered by listeners. Please do not present this material to non-adults.

To fully understand the trio's unique brand of humorous banter, you should to listen to show. I would recommend that the uninitiated begin with [Episode 2: Morning Powder](http://youlooknicetoday.com/episode/ep-2-morning-powder "Episode 2: Morning Powder") [^1] and listen to each episode sequentially via the convenient [Episode Guide](http://youlooknicetoday.com/episode-guide "Episode Guide") or via iTunes. _You Look Nice Today_ may not be for everyone, but it's definitely worth a shot.
