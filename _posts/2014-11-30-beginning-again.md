title: Once More With Feeling

---

For years now this website has been merely a shell that pointed people to my many profiles on other websites and social media services. It wasn’t always that way. It’s also housed a blog, a podcast, and even my photos at one point.

**It’s time to resurrect this site and make this place my own again.** A place to put the things I write and make. And more than that, a place to experiment.

Inspired by my [heroes](http://frankchimero.com/blog/homesteading-2014/) and my friends, I’ve decided to write under my name. I expect that what’s here will change a lot of over time, but I’ll try not to break too many links along the way.
