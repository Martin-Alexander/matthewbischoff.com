title: Beginning Again

---

For years now my [personal website](https://matthewbischoff.com) has been merely a shell that pointed people to my many profiles on other websites and social media services. That got boring.

**It’s time to resurrect this site and make this place my own again.**

Inspired by my heroes and my friends, I’ve decided to make this completely mine again. I expect that it will change a lot of over time, but what’s here now should be serviceable for the time being if you need to find out more about me or get in touch.
