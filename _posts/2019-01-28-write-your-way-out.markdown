In October 2016 I was honored to be invited to speak at Joe and Charles’s Release Notes conference. Release Notes, the outgrowth of a podcast with the same name, approaches the software business as a _business_. They’re motto is "everything but the  code". Here’s the audio and slides of the talk I gave there. It’s about writing. And how important I’ve found the skill of written communication to be as a software engineer, a product manager, and especially the owner of a software company. Let me know what you think.

_Tickets are now on sale for Release 2019 (they took a year off) in Mexico. If you run a software business, I can’t recommend it more strongly._
