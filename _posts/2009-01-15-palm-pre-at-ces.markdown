## Palm Pre at CES

I didn't watch the [CES video of the Palm Prē](http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/palm-pre-ces.html "Palm Prē") when it came out, but now that I've gotten around to it I can see what all the talk was about. It's some of the most innovative mobile user interface work I've seen since the iPhone launch. I can't wait to see how the device performs in the real world and how Apple responds.
