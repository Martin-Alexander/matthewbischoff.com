## Google Quick Search Box

An [open-source Mac application from Google](http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac "Google Quick Search Box") that integrates Google services and maintains many of the things I love about [Quicksilver](http://www.blacktree.com/ "Quicksilver"). Nicholas Jitkoff, who pioneered Quicksilver and [Google Mobile for iPhone](http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/mobile/apple/app.html "Google Mobile for iPhone"), continues to make Google a little better and a little mac-friendlier every day.
