A great video from Vanity Fair with Nicholas Britell who wrote the music for HBO’s Succession. This type of piece where you can watch a creator actually break down the _why_ behind their art is one of the most inspiring types of media for me. Seeing brilliant people work to elucidate their creations never gets old.
