<p>The <strong>app definition statement</strong> is a concept that I’ve been obsessed with since I first read about it in the original <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/AppDesign/AppDesign.html">iOS Human Interface Guidelines</a> back in 2008.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An app definition statement is a concise, concrete declaration of an app’s main purpose and its intended audience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not exactly an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">elevator pitch</a>, or a mission or vision statement, and it’s definitely not a spec. It’s just a definition. It’s what you would see if you looked your app up in the dictionary. It answers the questions “What?” and “For whom?”.</p>

<p>The process to create an app definition statement is pretty simple:</p>

<ol>
  <li>List all the features you think users might like</li>
  <li>Determine who your users are</li>
  <li>Filter the feature list through the audience definition</li>
</ol>

<p>You end up with a single sentence which you can use as a litmus test for everything you do. Whenever someone on your team proposes a feature or a design, you should be able to run that through your ADS to see if what you’re doing makes sense. Will my audience want or need this? Does it belong?</p>

<p>Right now it seems like our industry is worried primarily about <a href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/f445b04cbd20">growth hacking</a>, affiliate marketing, and App Store SEO. ==None of those things matter unless you make great software==. Doing this simple exercise is the best way I’ve found to make sure that you <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html">make something people want</a> without cluttering your idea or adding features for the sake of a checklist.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I <a href="http://branch.com/b/app-definition-statements">asked some iOS developers on Branch</a> for their app definition statements and got some great responses. Here are my favorites (coincidentally, some of my favorite apps):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://gradesapp.com"><strong>Grades</strong></a>: an app that shows students what they need to score on their next exam.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.languagesapp.com"><strong>Languages</strong></a>: lightning fast translation without an Internet connection.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper"><strong>Paper</strong></a>: where ideas begin.</li>
  <li><a href="http://basil-app.com"><strong>Basil</strong></a>: a single place for your favorite recipes and makes it easier to cook them.</li>
  <li><a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/"><strong>Drafts</strong></a>: where text starts. </li>
  <li><a href="http://bitbq.com/queueup/"><strong>QueueUp</strong></a>: Fast searching and adding for your Netflix Queue. </li>
</ul>

<p>These don’t all follow the exact same template, but they do give you a quick one sentence way to understand the app. They let you see why the developers may have cut certain features and included others.</p>

<p>Writing an ADS is the first step in any new software project I’m thinking about. As soon as I have one I’m happy with, I put it in the project <code>README</code> and start designing. </p>

<p>Do you write App Definition Statements, or have you found an even better way to define your work?</p>
