# Now

**Updated:** *{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }} from {{ page.place }}*

This page is [inspired by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). It covers the things I’m thinking, feeling, and working on, well, right now.

## Life 👱🏻

Usually, I in a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. But near the beginning of the [COVID-19 global pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), I realized I didn’t want to be isolated alone. So, for the time being, I’m self-quarantining in Toronto with my incredibly gracious partner [Kate Sloan](https://twitter.com/Girly_Juice). I’m scratching my various extrovert itches by playing [Jackbox](https://jackboxgames.com) with friends, hanging out on [Houseparty](https://houseparty.com/add/mattbischoff), attending [virtual events](http://risk-show.com), and calling my parents.

### Feelings 🙍🏼

I’m a little down right now because I miss my city, my friends, and working beside all the talented people at Lickability. But I’m also really glad to be spending so much time with Kate. And grateful that I’m not sick and have everything I need to live and work from here.

### Gender 🤷🏼

I [came out as nonbinary](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1150437952155242496) less than a year ago, and I’m still exploring my [gender identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) and [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression). New clothes, shoes, makeup, and ways of seeing myself and the world.

### 2020 Theme: Commit 🤝

Based on [The Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com), which I learned about through the [Cortex](http://cortex.fm) podcast, I choose a yearly theme. This year’s theme is **Commit** which means this year I aim to:

* Do things all the way. Finish them. Get them right. ✅
* Commit to a few things rather than half-assing many. 🧠
* Dedicate time, attention, and money to worthy projects, people, & ideas. ⏰

## Work 👅

My job as one of the partners at [Lickability](https://lickability.com) involves leading the team, setting product direction, helping with day-to-day operations, and talking to new and existing clients about what we can do for them. At the moment, I’m mostly focused on making sure our employees have everything they need to work well remotely, managing the development of 2 iOS apps for clients, and readying our next app, Scorecard, for release. [Join the beta here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/bkjqS6h4).

### App Critique 🧐

Just [re-started a project](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1243632324329254914) I first did in 2016 called App Critique. The goal is to show how I evaluate the design of software with short video design reviews.

If you’d like your app design scrutinized, [fill out this form](https://matthewbischoff.typeform.com/to/RjX8si). Preference will be given to indie devs and small companies.

### Talks 🗣

Working on a new talk about Accessibility for [App Builders CH](https://appbuilders.ch). I was excited about the chance to visit Switzerland for the first time in May, but now I’m psyched to be participating in their first remote event and giving folks stuck at home a great show.

## Media 💻

### Photography 📷

I’ve been focusing a bit more on photography recently. Here are the latest photos I’ve shared on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/mattb).

### Bookmarks 📌

I love organize [my bookmarks](https://pinboard.in/u:mattb) on [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/). Here are the latest five:

### Podcasts 🎙

I love listening to (and guesting on) podcasts, but I’m chronically behind on my backlog of shows because I oversubscribe. Some shows I’m binging lately: [Gender Reveal](https://www.genderpodcast.com), [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com), [The Heart](https://www.theheartradio.org) (it’s back!), and [You’re Wrong About](https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/youre-wrong-about/id1380008439).

If you’d like me to have me on your podcast, I’ve got all the time in the world at the moment, and I’d really love that. [Shoot me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Book%20Reccomendation), and let’s do it.

### Books 📚

These are the books I’m reading right now. My [notes and highlights](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/3162891-matthew-bischoff?ref=rnlp) are available on Goodreads. If you’d like to recommend a book, [send me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Book%20Reccomendation).

# Then

One time in 2003, I was on [an episode of Jeopardy!](https://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3342) and lost very badly.
