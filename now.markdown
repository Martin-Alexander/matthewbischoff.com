# /Now

This [Now page](https://sivers.org/nowff) was inspired by Derek Sivers. It covers the things I’m thinking about and working on, well, right now. *Last updated: March 29, 2020, from Toronto, ON.*

## Life

Usually, I live in New York City in a one-bedroom apartment in Gramercy. But at the beginning of the COVID-19 global pandemic, I realized I didn’t want to be isolated all alone. So, for the time being, I’m <strike>living</strike> quarantining in Toronto, Ontario with my partner Kate Sloan.

## Work

## Hobbies

## Speaking

## Photography

I’ve been focusing more on my photography recently. Here are the latest photos I’ve shared on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/mattb).

# /Then

One time in 2003, I was on [an episode of Jeopardy!](https://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3342) and lost very badly.
