# /Now

**Last updated:** *March 29, 2020, from Toronto, ON.*

This page was [inspired by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). It covers the things I’m thinking, feeling, and working on, well, right now.

## Photography 📷

I’ve been focusing a bit more on photography recently. Here are the latest photos I’ve shared on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/mattb).

## Life 👱🏻

Usually, I in a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. But near the beginning of the [COVID-19 global pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), I realized I didn’t want to be isolated alone. So, for the time being, I’m self-quarantining in Toronto, Ontario with my incredibly gracious partner [Kate Sloan](https://twitter.com/Girly_Juice). I’m scratching my various extrovert itches by playing [Jackbox](https://jackboxgames.com) with friends, hanging out on [Houseparty](https://houseparty.com/add/mattbischoff), attending [virtual events](http://risk-show.com), and calling my parents.

## Work 👅

My job as one of the partners at [Lickability](https://lickability.com) involves leading the team, setting product direction, helping with day-to-day operations, and talking to new and existing clients about what we can do for them. At the moment, I’m mostly focused on making sure the team has everything they need to work well remotely, managing the development of 2 iOS apps for clients, and readying our next app, Scorecard, for release.

## Feelings 🙍🏼

I’m a little down right now because I miss my city, my friends, and working beside all the talented people at Lickability. But I’m also really glad to be spending so much time with Kate. And grateful that I’m not sick and have everything I need to live and work from here.

## Hobbies 🍸

I’m always looking for great cocktails to mix up for friends. Lately I’ve been making lots of [Manhattans](https://imbibemagazine.com/manhattan/), [Martinis](https://imbibemagazine.com/martini/), and [Southsides](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/southside/). I should probably actually learn to cook one of these days.

I’m a huge nerd about productivity and tools. Lately I’ve been watching David Sparks’s Third Edition of the [OmniFocus Field Guide](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/omnifocus) and tweaking my OmniFocus setup to be even better. I’m also starting to think about what a personal [Notion](https://notion.so) would look like for me.

## Talks 🗣

Working on a new talk about Accessibility for [App Builders CH](https://appbuilders.ch). I was excited to visit Switzerland for the first time in May, but now I’m psyched to be participating in their first remote event and giving folks stuck at home a great show.

## Podcasts 🎙

I love listening to (and guesting on) podcasts, but I’m chronically behind on my backlog of shows because I oversubscribe. Some shows I’m binging lately: [Gender Reveal](https://www.genderpodcast.com), [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com), [The Heart](https://www.theheartradio.org) (it’s back!), and [You’re Wrong About](https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/youre-wrong-about/id1380008439).

If you’d like me to be on your podcast, I’d probably really enjoy that and I’ve got all the time in the world at the moment. [Shoot me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Book%20Reccomendation), and let’s do it.

## Books 📚

These are the books I’m reading right now. My [notes and highlights](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/3162891-matthew-bischoff?ref=rnlp) are available on Goodreads. If you’d like to recommend a book, [send me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Book%20Reccomendation).

# /Then

One time in 2003, I was on [an episode of Jeopardy!](https://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3342) and lost very badly.
